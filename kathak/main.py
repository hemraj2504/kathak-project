    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

# This is a simple Python script that starts a Flask application and runs it on a local server.

# The from app import app line imports the app object from a Flask application defined in a module named app. The app object is an instance of the Flask class and it contains all the configuration and functionality of the web application.


# The if __name__=='__main__': block is a common pattern used in Python scripts to define what should happen when the script is executed directly (as opposed to being imported as a module). In this case, the block is used to start the Flask application and run it on a local server.

# The app.run() method starts the Flask development server on the local machine. The host='0.0.0.0' argument specifies that the server should listen for incoming requests from any available network interface. The port=5000 argument specifies the port number on which the server should listen for incoming requests. When the server is running, it will display a URL that can be used to access the application in a web browser.

# In summary, this`` code sets up and runs a Flask application on a local server, making it accessible via a web browser on the specified port.
